The goal of actfts is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of actfts from:

``` r
install.packages("actfts")
devtools::install_github("SergioFinances/actfts")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(actfts)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':
#>   method            from
#>   as.zoo.data.frame zoo
## basic example code
```

You can include R chunks like so:

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
